  <h2> JavaScript </h2>
    <p>This is a prototype-based programming language , which corresponds to a
    scripting language . Unless for special purposes , an interpreter is built
    into every web browser . Today , along with HTML and CSS , it is one of the
    elements that make up the web. If HTML is in charge of the basic structure
    of a web page and CSS is in charge of design, then JavaScript is in charge
    of running the web page at the client level.[1] To compare web pages to
    automobiles, HTML is the car's skeleton, CSS is the car's exterior, and
    JavaScript is the car's power.
    It is a language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) that has little to
    do with Java . Similar names are not the same language. One of the things that
    people often get confused about. The actual driving method is also completely
    different from Java, which runs using the JVM , and JavaScript, which has a s
    cript engine ( interpreter ) in the browser .Ham and hamster are different,
    green onions and parsley are different, India is different from IndonesiaEven
    the derived specifications for web servers are different.</p>
